I'm Christopher Peters and I'm a data scientist and developer at [Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com/about). I'm a [W. Edwards Deming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Edwards_Deming)-[W.S. Gosset](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Sealy_Gosset)-type statistician.  That means I'm not very concerned about p-values and prefer to look at the world in a Bayesian way.  I'm interested in the question of, "how much?" rather than, "these two groups are statisticially significantly different."  If you're unsure about the difference between the two methods, try telling your marketing co-worker that your p-value is less than 0.05. :-))

Some of my interests include data mining, statistics, [snowboarding](http://i.imgur.com/rMdk65b.jpg) (hoping to do VT this season!), baysian analysis for ab testing, business  intelltigence.

I've helped build a business dashboard for Treehouse.  Some days I wake up and I'm a marketer, other days I'm trying to measure learning outcomes.

I'm a huge advocate of open-source software and a big-time autodidact.  With
some great resources, I've taught myself R, SAS, Stata, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, CoffeeScript, LaTeX, Vim, and a few other languages and tools. I love learning!

I have a Master's degree in Applied Statistics from [Louisiana State University](http://stats.lsu.edu). My committee members include: Louis A. Escobar (survival analyis), R. Carter Hill (econometrics), Brian Marx (p-splines, he invented them!).  

Here's some of my work:
