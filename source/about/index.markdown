I'm Christopher Peters and I'm a data scientist and developer at
[Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com/about).

Some of my interests include data mining, statistics, [snowboarding](http://i.imgur.com/rMdk65b.jpg) (hoping to do VT this season!), baysian analysis for ab testing, business  intelltigence.

I have a Master's degree in Applied Statistics from [Louisiana State
University](http://stats.lsu.edu). My committee members include: Louis A. Escobar (survival analyis), R. Carter Hill (econometrics), Brian Marx (p-splines, he invented them!).  

Here's some of my work:
